# StarWars Explorer

**StarWars Explorer** is a responsive and interactive web application that allows users to explore characters, planets, vehicles, and films from the Star Wars universe. This project was developed as part of **Assignment 1** in the Front-End Development course at Kristiania University College.

## Project Description

The application fetches data from the Star Wars API (SWAPI) and displays it in a visually engaging card layout with accompanying images. Users can navigate between categories and return to the homepage via a fixed top-right button. The app handles API errors gracefully by displaying user-friendly messages.

## Developer Notes

- Images are manually linked via `/assets/images/...` and placed in the `public/` directory to ensure compatibility with static hosting.
- All data is fetched dynamically from the SWAPI API and not hardcoded.
- This project was developed individually as part of a course assignment and reflects my own work and understanding.
- I have used CHATGPT if i was stuck on something or needed help with something. but mainly I have done what we have learned in class.
